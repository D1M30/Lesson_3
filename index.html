   <p class="text">
      The beginning of grilling can be traced back to the 17th century when you look at the Arawak tribe of the Caribbean and South America. These people used sticks to create a flame over a fire and place the meat on it. They called this method of cooking Barbacoa. This idea was adopted by conquerors from Spain, who evolved it until the 18th century when people in southeastern America took up the idea. Pigs spent hours roasting over a fire, and various sauces and different types of wood were used to give different flavors to the meat.

   <p>In 1897, Ellsworth B. A. Zwoyer was the first to patent a design for charcoal briquettes, although his thunder was somewhat stolen by the Kingsford company, who many associate with grilling. This company was created by Henry Ford, and he used wood scraps and sawdust that he got from the assembly lines of his cars to create the charcoal.</p>

<p class="text color">There isn’t much about the barbecue grill until the late 1940s, when more people were choosing to live in the suburbs after the war. During this time, many backyards became filled with grills. However, these mass-produced appliances were commonly known for burning the meat and creating a large amount of ash. The concept was refined in 1952 by a welder named George Stephen. He cut metal to make dome-shaped grills, using the top half as a lid to seal in the flavor and help distribute heat more evenly. He then added vents so that the fire wouldn’t smother. This design is what many people think of when they think about barbecue grills today, as many modern models are based on this model.</p>

     <p class="text-text">The next change didn’t come until the 1980s, when a man by the name of Bill Best added ceramic burners to barbecues. The idea was that the tile was heated by the propane, creating infrared radiation to cook the food directly. This is the design commonly used in restaurants for its ability to more evenly cook food while also locking in the juices, keeping the meat tender and flavorful.</p>

      By the 1990s, people were becoming more health-conscious and began to view excess body fat negatively. Then came the invention of the George Foreman grill, known for reducing fat. The design grilled from both the top and bottom while allowing the fat to drain off. Sales were in the hundreds of millions, and the name is still well-known today.

   <p>The 2000s saw more advancements in grilling. Infrared grills became cheaper as the patent on them expired; however, they still cost enough that they are not available to everyone. In 2004, the world’s largest grill was created on Big, a show featured on the Discovery Channel. At over 15 feet high, it could barbecue a 10-foot-long hotdog! In the last ten years, small portable gas grills have become popular for picnicking.
